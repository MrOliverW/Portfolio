# Portfolio README
Welcome to Oliver Warlick's Professional Portfolio

This is a live portfolio which updates in progression with my career advancement (so stay tuned!).

As of the current version, here are some updates:
Temporarily removing the Contact and Linkedin Page (see below for me)

Enhancing the navigation (also called "nav") bar: 
-BIG: Removing creation of new tab each time a user clicks a button.
-BIG: Change backgrounds to white. Update colors.
Update Bio on index.html page to talk about Weekend web work.
-BIG: Update Banner on the following projects gITHUB pages: DO NOT UPDATE BANNERS UNTIL DESIGN IS FINALIZED
    *Add Breathe In seattle Page once rebranding is finished
     Discord Bot Project Page.
     Form Processing Page
     Dom Maniputation Page
     RENAME CREATURES PAGE and update banner

- Adding a cool LinkedIn button which linked to my LinkedIn (said link 3 times there)
- Changing the nav buttons as follows:
    Changing "LinkedIn & Contact button to just "Contact" button (or maybe contact me or get in touch) 
    Adding a .html page for the Contact page

    Changing the GitHub Button to a logo (similar to LinkedIn);
        possibly listing the Full GitHub logo or may be reducing the Linkein logo so they are both similar size

    Adding a .html page for Resume which links to a text version of resume (with clickable clinks on the contact sections ...perhaps).
    There will be a prompt to download resume when page is clicked, as well as show this page, and have a button to
    download resume on page (as docx) (as pdf).

    Change Case Study page to a .html (like you did with projects) 

    Add a calendely Link.
